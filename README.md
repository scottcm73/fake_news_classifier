# fake_news_classifier

This fake news classifier attempts to use machine learning to make predictions about whether or not a news article is true (0) or it is suspected to be false or unreliable (1).

The data is available from Kaggle at:

A resources folder holds the data, and eventually also holds the pickled files for the vectorized matricies that HashingVectorizer creates.
